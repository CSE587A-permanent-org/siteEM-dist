# siteEM

You will find the assignment instructions in
[siteEM/assignment.ipynb](siteEM/assignment.ipynb). As with
the other labs, the only code which will be graded is in
[siteEM/assignment.py](siteEM/assignment.py). You need to write code
in that file such that the tests in
[siteEM/test_assignment.py](siteEM/test_assignment.py) pass.
